**Final Notice From ApostoIic Nunciature-Confidential** - received malware email
![Screenshot with the phishing email I've received containing a malware document](screenshot.jpg)

A while ago, I was checking my email and noticed an unusual one. I opened it and noticed it contained a html attachement. I realised that it wasn't a newsletter, but mostly a phishing atempt not going right (for them) -  the [file](./Fr.%20Je(1).html) didn't load. I had my NAS attacked before by such thieves and lost important data already.

As you may notive, I had to blur the email list for privacy reasons. Anyway our eamils were leaked.
You may notice the sender is **remiebatalla@yahoo.ca**. The attachement's file name is **Fr. Je(1).html** - exactly as I received it.

The only reason I'm sharing this file is because I saw on some YouTube channels people being able to reverse engineer these scripts and make the scammers lose. So if anyone is able to do this, please! Just pay these scam-bugs back what they diserve! 

The file itself looks harmful, but I wouldn't load it on a preview server, unless you're on a VM. I've opened it on my IDE locally, but didn't run it, just read through it. At a point I couldn't follow the scripts anymore, because I didn't understand what they're doing.

If anyone deals with this, please let me know. I'd be happy to see someone took revenge on the scammers.

DISCLAIMER:
- The repo is created to make the possibility of **malware analysis open** and **available to the public**
- ...and for the purpose of fighting these thieves back.
- Please don't open/run the malware file unless you know what you're doing. 
- If by publising this file I break any rules, please let me know so I simply remove it.
